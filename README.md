# Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm

This repository provides a Python implementation of Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm, a fundamental computer graphics algorithm for rasterizing straight lines on a pixel-based grid. It is efficient and operates using integer arithmetic, avoiding floating-point calculations.

## Features
- Efficient computation of pixel coordinates to draw a straight line.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation for educational purposes.
- Visualizes the computed line using Matplotlib.

## How It Works
Bresenham's Line Algorithm iteratively selects the next pixel that best approximates the theoretical line by evaluating a decision parameter. Depending on the value of the parameter, the next pixel is chosen to be either East (E) or North-East (NE).

## Files
- `bresenham_line.py`: Contains the implementation and visualization of the algorithm.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- Matplotlib library for plotting the visualization

To install Matplotlib, run:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Copy the code into a file named `bresenham_line.py`.
2. Run the script to execute the algorithm and visualize the rasterized line.

### Example Code
The script demonstrates how to compute and visualize a line between two points:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    x1, y1 = 2, 2  # Start point
    x2, y2 = 10, 6  # End point

    line_points = plot_bresenham_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    print(line_points)
```

### Output
- The script generates a plot showing the rasterized line on a grid.
- The computed line points are printed to the console.

#### Sample Console Output:
```
[(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 6), (10, 6)]
```

#### Sample Visualization
The line is plotted on a grid, with blue markers representing the computed pixels.

## Functions
### `bresenham_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
Calculates the rasterized points of a line between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `x1, y1`: Starting point coordinates
  - `x2, y2`: Ending point coordinates
- **Returns**: A list of tuples representing pixel coordinates.

### `plot_bresenham_line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
Visualizes the line generated by the `bresenham_line` function using Matplotlib.

- **Parameters**:
  - `x1, y1`: Starting point coordinates
  - `x2, y2`: Ending point coordinates
- **Returns**: None (Displays the plot)

## Notes
- This implementation assumes `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2`. For other cases, the code may require adaptation.
